Welcome to Intern Base! I hope that you will enjoy your journey learning about cybersecurity and hacking, just like I did when I went through these challenges. 

Some tips I have for new participants: <br>

- When in doubt, always try to Google first before asking others. Sometimes, the challenges rely on you knowing how to Google your way through certain challenges
