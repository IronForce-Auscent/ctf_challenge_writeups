You've done an amazing job, Intern! Not only did you help establish our new space communications satellite by launching a rocket into space, but you also located and decoded an alien signal and uncovered a mysterious alien artefact!

The adventure doesn't stop here, we have more mysteries to uncover and we think you're the right person to help us solve them! Keep up the great work!
